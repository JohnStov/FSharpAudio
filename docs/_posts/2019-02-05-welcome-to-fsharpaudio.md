# Welcome to FSharp Audio

I'm going to use this repo and blog to develop an audio engine in FSharp and to try to port the code to work work on various different platforms, using the power of .NET Core, Fable and WebAssembly.

The spur for this is the [Applied FSharp Challenge](http://foundation.fsharp.org/applied_fsharp_challenge). If things work out, I will probably submit this.
